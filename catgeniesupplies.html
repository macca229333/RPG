<h2>CatGenie Supplies &amp; Accessories</h2>

<p>The CatGenie is an easy to use automatic cat litter box that requires very little maintenance to run
    effectively! Your CatGenie unit requires 2 supplies to begin a cleaning cycle; SaniSolution and Washable Granules.
    SaniSolution is an eco-friendly formula designed to sanitise the CatGenie bowl and Granules keeping your cat's
    toileting area clean and fresh. One SaniSolution cartridge lasts up to 4 months with one cat. Available in Fresh
    Scent or Scent Free.</p>

<p>The Washable Granules<em> never</em> need changing or scooping! One box of Washable Granules lasts up to 4 months.
    How? The Granules are made from a non-absorbent combination of natural and synthetic materials. The Granules are
    completely safe for pets and people, and unlike other forms of cat litter that can take quite a huge toll on the
    environment, CatGenie Granules are environmentally friendly and will naturally degrade in septic systems in just 9
    months.</p>
